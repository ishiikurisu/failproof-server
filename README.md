# Failproof Checklists - The web app!

This is the code of the web app that is running on [Heroku][2]. Basically, this is a serverless app that will enable users to actually consume these checklists as they want. They can download checklists from our database or create their own.

**WARNING!** This still is experimental code.

## Prerequisites

This is a Luminus project. You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed.


## Running

To start a web server for the application just like it is ran on the real server, run:

    lein run
