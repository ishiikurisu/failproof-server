# Failproof Checklists - The web app!

Basically, this
is a serverless app that will enable users to actually consume these checklists
as they want. They can download checklists from our database or create their
own.

**WARNING!** This still is experimental code.

## Running

Just run

    node server.js

To check the site running from a server. It shouldn't need it though.
